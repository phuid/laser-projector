# Tutorial
## Hardware
## Software
there are two ways of doing this, you can

- [install from a disk image](#installing-whole-system-from-my-disk-image)
  - much much easier
  - you need to download a 4GB file

  or

- [install the executables and dependencies yourself](#installing-executables-from-my-repo-source-code)
  - objectively harder
  - needs node and npm installed (i think node comes with the normal version of RPI OS preinstalled but i was using RPI OS Lite, since i needed to fit all this into a small .img file and was using a 4GB SD card)
    - **discord.js library requires node v16.6.0 or newer and npm v8.3.0 or newer**
    - using [Node version manager](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) - [install tutorial](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating), [usage](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#usage)
      - much more flexible
      - you can choose node and npm version
    - [download and install node and npm binaries yourself](https://www.makersupplies.sg/blogs/tutorials/how-to-install-node-js-and-npm-on-the-raspberry-pi)

### installing whole system from my disk image

### installing executables from my repo source code 

#### cloning my repository
```git clone ```
#### Installing lasershow executable from made by https://github.com/tteskac for his [/rpi-lasershow](https://github.com/tteskac/rpi-lasershow) project




## Software Instalation

## Hardware construction
this part is not gonna be added untill around Febuary 2022, since that's when my brother is gonna start working on modeling the case and when we are gonna buy the Galvos and all other components and put them together.
